# Frontend Interview Task: Exam Management System

This is a **Next.js** project designed to implement an **Exam Management System** where users can create, edit, and manage exams with multiple-choice questions.

## Project Overview

The application allows users to:

- Create and edit exams with multiple-choice questions.
- Designate correct answers and ensure validation before submission.
- View a list of stored exams and update them as needed.

The project was bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050) in your browser to access the application.

### Editing the Project

To start editing, modify the `pages/index.tsx` file for the main page or any other page. Changes will be automatically reflected in the browser.

## Features

- **Next.js (Page Router)**: The project uses the traditional `pages` directory for routing.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety across the application.
- **Local Storage**: Exam data is persisted using local storage.
- **ShadCN Toaster**: Implemented for notifications when creating or editing exams.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have:

- Node.js installed
- `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` installed for dependency management.

## How to Use

1. **Create an Exam**: Navigate to the exam editor and add questions, answers, and mark the correct answer.
2. **View and Edit Exams**: Go to the exam list to view all exams and update them as needed.
3. **Deploy**: Easily deploy the application using platforms like Vercel.
